# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on **Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics** - where digital intelligence meets the physical world.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This course bridges the gap between AI systems that exist purely in software and **embodied intelligence** - AI that understands and operates in physical reality. You'll master:

- 🤖 **ROS 2** - The nervous system of modern robots
- 🎮 **Gazebo & Unity** - Creating digital twins for simulation
- 🧠 **NVIDIA Isaac** - Advanced AI perception and training
- 🗣️ **Vision-Language-Action** - Natural language control of robots

## 🌟 Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they:
- Share our physical form factor
- Can navigate spaces designed for humans
- Learn from abundant human interaction data
- Represent the next evolution from digital to embodied AI

## 📚 Course Structure

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Learn the middleware that powers modern robotics - nodes, topics, services, and how to integrate Python AI agents with robot controllers.

**Duration:** Weeks 3-5 | [Start Module 1 →](/module-1/introduction)

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Master physics simulation and environment building. Create high-fidelity virtual worlds where robots can learn safely.

**Duration:** Weeks 6-7 | [Start Module 2 →](/module-2/introduction)

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
Dive into photorealistic simulation, synthetic data generation, and hardware-accelerated perception for real-time robot intelligence.

**Duration:** Weeks 8-10 | [Start Module 3 →](/module-3/introduction)

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
Integrate large language models with robotics - enabling robots to understand and execute natural language commands.

**Duration:** Week 13 | [Start Module 4 →](/module-4/introduction)

## 🎓 Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will:

✅ Understand the principles of Physical AI and embodied intelligence  
✅ Build and deploy ROS 2 packages for robot control  
✅ Simulate complex robot behaviors in Gazebo and Unity  
✅ Develop AI perception pipelines using NVIDIA Isaac  
✅ Design humanoid robots capable of natural human interaction  
✅ Integrate GPT models for conversational robotics  

## 🚀 Capstone Project: The Autonomous Humanoid

Your final project combines everything you've learned:

> **Challenge:** Create a simulated humanoid robot that receives a voice command ("Clean the room"), plans a path using Nav2, navigates obstacles with VSLAM, identifies objects using computer vision, and manipulates them with robotic hands.
